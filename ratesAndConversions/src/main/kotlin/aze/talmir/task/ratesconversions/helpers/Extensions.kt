/**
 * The lazy function has an argument with a default value
 * that controls its synchronization behaviour. If a lazy
 * property is accessed from multiple threads concurrently,
 * synchronization will need to be handled by choosing an
 * appropriate [LazyThreadSafetyMode].
 *
 * The default value [LazyThreadSafetyMode.SYNCHRONIZED]
 * will ensure only a single thread can initialize the
 * property using locks. If we are sure the property will
 * only be accessed by a single thread we can switch to
 * [LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE] to avoid the overhead of
 * performing the synchronization. There is also the option
 * of using [LazyThreadSafetyMode.PUBLICATION] which allows
 * multiple threads to call the initializer, but only the
 * first returned value being used.
 *
 * Most UI code, such as in an Activity or Fragment, will
 * run on the UI thread and so properties that are only used
 * here can use the [LazyThreadSafetyMode.NONE]. We could
 * even add an extension to avoid specifying this each time.
